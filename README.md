This is the github repository for ftc team 9054,viridian robotics' website. 
Our website was created using Jekyll which useful for creating static websites that are almost dynamic. Jekyll is integrated with github pages and is used for github's own blogs and tutorials.
The website is mostly built using vanilla html/css. Boostrap is used for a few components like our navigation bar, but css grid and flexboxes are mostly used for formatting.
